A command-line program in Python in three different modes: Player VS Player, Player VS Computer, and Computer VS Computer. This powerful engine called ChessCore is based on the Baron opening book, and operates with an alphabeta search, which is an enhancement to the Minimax algorithm. This can be converted to a more Python-friendly algorithm with the Negamax Framework. Aside from the alphabeta search, this chess engine also checks for the quiescence of a move, meaning that it will make captures as long as they have a fair or advantageous value. This program displays an ASCII picture of the board after each move and saves the result of every game to a data file.
